README 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This package contains code and data that calulates and tests differences in 
realative mutation frequancy between Control and brca mutatants. Full details 
of the study can be found in Hirth et al., "Regulation of the germinal center 
reaction and somatic hypermutation dynamics by homologus recombination", Jounal 
of Immunology. If any part of the code is used for academic purposes or 
publications, please cite the above mentioned paper.
